Lycan Protocol is more than just an NFT. It is a story-based project that evolves fluidly with community involvement. From the moment you join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/lycanprotocol) your actions could impact the narrative!

## Project Details

- 6,666 Tokens
- First 666 can be claimed for free by accounts on the allowlist (1 free mint per account)
- **Mint Price:** 0.066 ETH
- 10 mints per wallet for public
- Transform your Lycan from Human to Wolf form (COMING SOON!)

Tokens minted from the contract will grant you access to both our communityâ€”in the form of both the character-driven storyline and the ability to vote on Hunting.

## Royalties

A 6.6% royalty is honored for secondary sales on our NFTs, and is split as follows:

- 4% [Community wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92c96972c40488597417110a68e7cd1d2f6e811f)
- 1% [FWB Treasury](https://etherscan.io/token/0x35bd01fc9d6d5d81ca9e055db88dc49aa2c699a8?a=0x660f6d6c9bcd08b86b50e8e53b537f2b40f243bd)
- 1% Wolf Sanctuary
- 0.66% back to our artists

## Hunting

Each holder of at least 6 Lycan Protocol NFTs may nominate an NFT project that fits within our community gidelines to perform a floor sweep on.
On the night of each full moon, we will hold a Twitter Spaces for the community to vote on which project to sweep. The top 6 voted will be put into [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/) and one project will be randomly selected to be **hunted**.

30 minutes after the winner is decided, **the hunt** will begin. Our community wallet will then buy 6 ETH worth of that NFT from the floor price.

**NOTE:** This is an ongoing experiment. We realize the window of time leaves room for front-running by holders or other actors. \*We are not liable for any loss of funds due to any chaos caused by the hunt. If you are not financially secure enough to take part, we advist you to abstain.
